Description: This package provides basic elements for defining Zope permissions and
        security checkers without ZCML.

        Setting up ``grokcore.security``
        ================================
        
        This package is essentially set up like the `grokcore.component`_
        package, please refer to its documentation for details.  The
        additional ZCML lines you will need are::
        
          <include package="grokcore.security" file="meta.zcml" />
          <include package="grokcore.security" />
        
        Put this somewhere near the top of your root ZCML file but below the
        line where you include ``grokcore.component``'s configuration.
        
        
        Defining permissions
        ====================
        
        In `grokcore.component`_, various components are defined (and
        automatically registered) by subclassing from certain baseclasses.
        The same applies to defining permissions with ``grokcore.security`` as
        well::
        
          import grokcore.security
        
          class EditContent(grokcore.security.Permission):
              grokcore.security.name('mypkg.EditContent')
        
        This defines a permission with the ID ``mypkg.EditContent``.  You must
        always specify this ID explicitly.  In addition, you can also give the
        permission a human-readable title and description.  This is useful
        when your application provides lists of permissions somewhere and you
        don't want to bother users with deciphering the dotted IDs::
        
          import grokcore.security
        
          class EditContent(grokcore.security.Permission):
              grokcore.security.name('mypkg.EditContent')
              grokcore.security.title('Edit content')
              grokcore.security.description('Anyone who has this permission may '
                                            'modify content in the application.')
        
        
        Defining checkers for components
        ================================
        
        ``grokcore.security`` provides some means for defining checkers for
        components:
        
        * ``grokcore.security.require(permission)`` which can be used either
          as a class-level directive to set a permission for a whole
          component, or as a decorator to set a permission for a function or
          method.
        
        * ``protect_getattr`` and ``protect_setattr``, available from
          ``grokcore.security.util``, which take a class, an attribute name
          and a permission as arguments and define Zope security checkers for
          getting or setting a particular attribute on instance of said class.
        
        With these, you can build grokkers for components that need security
        declarations.  For instance, the `grokcore.view`_ package uses them to
        define a grokker that makes security declarations for views::
        
          class ViewSecurityGrokker(martian.ClassGrokker):
              martian.component(grokcore.view.View)
              martian.directive(grokcore.security.require, name='permission')
        
              def execute(self, factory, config, permission, **kw):
                  for method_name in zope.publisher.interfaces.browser.IBrowserPage:
                      config.action(
                          discriminator=('protectName', factory, method_name),
                          callable=grokcore.security.util.protect_getattr,
                          args=(factory, method_name, permission),
                          )
                  return True
        
        With such a grokker, it is possible to protect views like so::
        
          class Edit(grokcore.view.View):
              grokcore.security.require(EditContent)
        
        Note how we can simply pass a permission class to the ``require``
        directive.  Alternatively, you can pass the permission ID::
        
          class Edit(grokcore.view.View):
              grokcore.security.require('mypkg.EditContent')
        
        If you wanted to be able to define permissions for individual class
        methods rather than the whole class, you would simply base your
        grokker on ``martian.MethodGrokker`` rather than ``ClassGrokker``.
        The actual mechanics of defining a checker are the same.
        
        Please note that ``grokcore.security`` does not yet provide directives
        that allow you to specify permissions for simple attribute access
        (read and write).
        
        
        API overview
        ============
        
        ``Permission``
            Base class for defining permissions.  Use the ``name`` directive
            to define the mandatory permission ID.  Optionally use the
            ``title`` and ``description`` directives to give the permission
            human-readable information.
        
        ``Public``
            Special permission that can be referred to whenever a component
            should not be protected by a permission at all (public access).
        
        ``require(permission_class_or_id)``
            declares that the use of a particular component (when used as a
            class-level directive) or a method (when used as a method
            decorator) requires a certain permission.  The argument can either
            be a permission class (subclass of ``Permission``) or a permission
            ID.
        
        In addition, the ``grokcore.security`` package exposes the
        `grokcore.component`_ API.

        Changes
        =======
        
        1.6.3 (2016-01-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Update tests.
        
        
        1.6.2 (2012-05-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Properly declare zope.dottedname as a dependency.
        
        1.6.1 (2012-05-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix the package to properly work if the extra ``role`` is not
          specified.
        
        1.6 (2012-05-01)
        ----------------
        
        - The Permission and Role components moved from the grok package to the
          grokcore.security package where it belongs.
        
        - The permissions() directive moved from the grok package to
          grokcore.security where it belongs.
        
        1.5 (2010-11-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Upped the requirements for martian and grokcore.component.
        
        - Made package comply to zope.org repository policy.
        
        1.4 (2009-12-13)
        ----------------
        
        * **note** Backed out the version requirements for
          grokcore.component-2.0 and martian-0.12. These requirements
          stood in the way of further development especially towards
          grok-1.1 based on the ZTK. The 1.3 version should probably
          have been called 2.0 like with grokcore.component.
        
        * Ported setup.py dependency fixes from trunk.
        
        * Use zope.security instead of zope.app.security.
        
        1.3 (2009-09-16)
        ----------------
        
        * Use the grok.zope.org/releaseinfo information instead of our own
          copy of ``versions.cfg``, for easier maintenance.
        
        * Depend on grokcore.component 2.0 and the 0.12 Martian - this changes
          inheritance issues but doesn't appear to affect grokcore.security
          itself.
        
        1.2 (2009-09-14)
        ----------------
        
        * Changed the default permissions from grok.View to zope.View. There seems no
          particular reason not to use the standard zope.View permission defined
          in zope.app.security.
        
          NOTE: YOU MUST STILL ASSIGN THIS PERMISSION TO USERS IN YOUR
          site.zcml FILE. OTHERWISE YOU DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ANY VIEWS.
        
        * Made sure to include zope.app.security configuration as well, as that
          package defines the zope.View permission. Note that in the future this will
          change to zope.security.
        
        * Bring versions.cfg in line with grok 1.0 release candidate
          versions.cfg.
        
        
        1.1 (2009-07-03)
        ----------------
        
        * Changed the default permissions from zope.Public to grok.View.
        
          NOTE: YOU MUST ASSIGN THIS PERMISSION TO USERS IN YOUR
          site.zcml FILE. OTHERWISE YOU DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ANY VIEWS.
        
        1.0 (2008-08-03)
        ----------------
        
        * Created ``grokcore.security`` in July 2008 by factoring
          security-related components, grokkers and directives out of Grok.
