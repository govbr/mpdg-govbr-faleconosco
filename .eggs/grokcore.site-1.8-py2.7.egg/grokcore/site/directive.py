    Place this directive inside of a `grokcore.site.Site` subclass,
    and provide the name of a utility you want activated inside of
    that site::

        class MySite(grokcore.site.Site):
            grok.local_utility(MyMammothUtility)
            ...

    This directive can be supplied several times within the same site.
    Thanks to the presence of this directive, any time an instance of
    your class is created in the Zope database it will have a copy of
    the given local utility installed along with it.

    This directive accepts several normal Component-registration keyword
    arguments, like `provides` and `name`, and uses them each time it
    registers your local utility.

    If you do not supply a `provides` keyword, then Grok attempts to
    guess a sensible default.  Its first choice is to use any
    interface(s) that you listed with the grok.provides() directive
    when defining your utility.  Otherwise, if your utility is a
    subclass of `grokcore.site.LocalUtility`, then Grok will use any
    interfaces that your utility supplies beyond those are supplied
    because of its inheritance from `grokcore.site.LocalUtility`.
    Else, as a final fallback, it checks to see whether the class you
    are registering supplies one, and only one, interface; if so, then
    it can register the utility unambiguously as providing that one
    interface.
