Description: 
        This package provides support to write local site and utilities for
        Zope directly in Python (without ZCML).

        Setting up ``grokcore.site``
        ============================
        
        This package is essentially set up like the `grokcore.component`_
        package, please refer to its documentation for details.  The only
        additional ZCML line you will need is::
        
          <include package="grokcore.site" />
        
        Put this somewhere near the top of your root ZCML file but below the
        line where you include ``grokcore.component``'s configuration.
        
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        Global utilities are already managed by `grokcore.component`_.
        
        Here a simple example of a local utility::
        
          from zope.interface import implements, Interface
          import grokcore.site
        
          class IKangaroo(Interface):
        
              def jump():
                 """Make all kangaroos jump somewhere.
                 """
        
          class KangarooUtility(grokcore.site.LocalUtility):
              implements(IKangaroo)
        
              def jump(self):
                  pass
        
        
        Now, we can register our utility to a local site. That will create
        automatically, and register that utility when we create that site::
        
        
           class Jungle(grokcore.site.Site):
        
               grokcore.site.local_utility(KangarooUtility, IKangaroo)
        
        
        If you don't add the last line, you will still have your site, but
        nothing to make jump your kangaroo. Then, you will be able to add
        manually by hand after (if you want).
        
        
        API Overview
        ============
        
        Base classes
        ------------
        
        ``Site``
           Base class for your site.
        
        ``LocalUtility``
           Base class for a ZODB-persitent local utility.
        
        
        Directives
        ----------
        
        ``local_utility(factory, provides=None, name=u'', setup=None, public=False, name_in_container=None``)
           Directive used on a site to register a local utility at the
           creation time:
        
           ``factory``
              Would be the component to register (required parameter),
        
           ``provides``
              Would be the interface used to query the local utility (required
              parameter),
        
           ``name``
              Would be the name used to query the local utility,
        
           ``setup``
              Would be a function taking parameter. If defined it will be
              called after the utility is created with it as first and unique
              parameter.
        
           ``public``
              If true, the utility will be created in the site container
              itself, not in the site manager, and public will be able to
              access it directly.
        
           ``name_in_container``
              Would be used as id for the utility in container itwill be
              created. If not defined it will ask NameChooser to pick a name
              for it.
        
        In addition, the ``grokcore.site`` package exposes the
        `grokcore.component`_ API.

          configured local sites.
        
        - Rename ``ApplicationInitializedEvent`` to ``ApplicationAddedEvent``.
        
        - When the ``IApplicationAddedEvent`` is triggered the new application
          will be current Zope local site. The site is restored after the
          event.
        
        
        1.6.1 (2012-05-02)

        - Exposed ApplicationInitializedEvent and IApplicationInitializedEvent.
        
        - Added the missing import for the exposed IApplication interface.
        
        1.6 (2012-05-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Moved the directive `site` from Grok to this package.
        
        - Moved the component `Application` and all the related utilities from Grok
          to this package.
        
        1.5 (2011-01-03)
        ----------------
        
        - Moved IApplication and getApplication from the Grok package into
          this one.
        
        1.4 (2010-11-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Upped versions requirements for martian and grokcore.component.
        
        1.3 (2010-10-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Made package comply to repository policy.
        
        - Update functional tests to only use zope.app.appsetup instead
          of zope.app.testing.
        
        - Update functional tests not to require zope.app.zcmlfiles
          anymore.
        
        1.2 (2009-12-20)
        ----------------
        
        * Migrated imports from zope.app.component to zope.site.
        
        1.1 (2009-09-18)
        ----------------
        
        * Updated dependencies (added missing ones and added separate test
          dependencies).
        
        * A local utility now implements IAttributeAnnotatable.
        
        * Update code documentation from Grok itself.
        
        * Use 1.0b2 versions.cfg in Grok's release info instead of a local
          copy; a local copy for all grokcore packages is just too hard to
          maintain.
        
        
        1.0.1 (2009-06-30)
        ------------------
        
        * Reupload to pypi with a correct version of Python which doesn't have
          a distutils bug.
        
        1.0 (2009-06-29)
        ----------------
        
        * Created ``grokcore.site`` by factoring local site based components,
          grokkers and directives out of Grok.
