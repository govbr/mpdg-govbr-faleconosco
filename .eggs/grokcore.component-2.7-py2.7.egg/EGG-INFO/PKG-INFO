Description: This package provides base classes of basic component types for the
        Zope Component Architecture, as well as means for configuring and
        registering them directly in Python (without ZCML).

        How to set up ``grokcore.component``
        ====================================
        
        In the following we assume you're writing or extending an application
        that does bootstrap configuration using ZCML.  There's always a single
        ZCML file that is executed when the application is started, which then
        includes everything else.  Let's assume this file is called
        ``site.zcml`` (that's what it's called in Zope), so that file is what
        we'll be editing.
        
        In order to register the components that you wrote using the base
        classes and directives available from ``grokcore.component``, we'll
        use the ``<grok:grok />`` ZCML directive.  But before we can use it,
        we need to make sure it's available to the ZCML machinery.  We do this
        by including the meta configuration from ``grokcore.component``::
        
          <include package="grokcore.component" file="meta.zcml" />
        
        Put this line somewhere to the top of ``site.zcml``, next to other
        meta configuration includes.  Now, further down the line, we can tell
        the machinery in ``grokcore.component`` to register all components in
        your package (let's say it's called ``helloworld``)::
        
          <grok:grok package="helloworld" />
        
        To sum up, your ``site.zcml`` file should look like something like this::
        
          <configure
              xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
              xmlns:grok="http://namespaces.zope.org/grok">
        
            <!-- do the meta configuration to make the ZCML directives available -->
            <include package="zope.foobar" file="meta.zcml" />
            <include package="zope.frobnaz" file="meta.zcml" />
            <include package="grokcore.component" file="meta.zcml" />
        
            <!-- now load the configuration of packages that we depend on -->
            <include package="zope.barfoo" />
            <include package="zope.somethingorother" />
        
            <!-- finally load my components which are based on grokcore.component -->
            <grok:grok package="helloworld" />
        
          </configure>
        
        There is an optional ``exclude`` on the `grok` directive. It allows to specify
        names of packages or modules that if encountered won't be grokked. These
        names might contain unix shell-style wildcards.
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        Adapter
        -------
        
        Here's a simple adapter that may be useful in Zope.  It extracts the
        languages that a user prefers from the request::
        
          import grokcore.component
          from zope.publisher.interfaces.browser import IBrowserRequest
          from zope.i18n.interfaces import IUserPreferredLanguages
        
          class CookieLanguage(grokcore.component.Adapter):
              """Extract the preferred language from a cookie"""
              grokcore.component.context(IBrowserRequest)
              grokcore.component.implements(IUserPreferredLanguages)
        
              # No need to implement __init__, it's already provided by the base class.
        
              def getPreferredLanguages(self):
                  # This an adapter for the request, so self.context is the request.
                  request = self.context
        
                  # Extract the preferred language from a cookie:
                  lang = request.cookies.get('language', 'en')
        
                  # According to IUserPreferredLanguages, we must return a list.
                  return [lang]
        
        Multi-adapter
        -------------
        
        Here's a multi-adapter that functions as a content provider as known
        from the ``zope.contentprovider`` library.  Content providers are
        components that return snippets of HTML.  They're multi-adapters for
        the content object (model), the request and the view that they're
        supposed to be a part of::
        
          import grokcore.component
          from zope.publisher.interfaces.browser import IBrowserRequest
          from zope.publisher.interfaces.browser import IBrowserPage
          from zope.contentprovider.interfaces import IContentProvider
        
          class HelloWorldProvider(grokcore.component.MultiAdapter):
              """Display Hello World!"""
              grokcore.component.adapts(Interface, IBrowserRequest, IBrowserPage)
              grokcore.component.implements(IContentProvider)
        
              def __init__(self, context, request, view):
                  pass
        
              def update(self):
                  pass
        
              def render(self):
                  return u'<p>Hello World!</p>'
        
        
        Global utility
        --------------
        
        Here's a simple named utility, again from the Zope world.  It's a
        translation domain.  In other words, it contains translations of user
        messages and is invoked when the i18n machinery needs to translate
        something::
        
          import grokcore.component
          from zope.i18n.interfaces import ITranslationDomain
        
          class HelloWorldTranslationDomain(grokcore.component.GlobalUtility):
              grokcore.component.implements(ITranslationDomain)
              grokcore.component.name('helloworld')
        
              domain = u'helloworld'
        
              def translate(self, msgid, mapping=None, context=None,
                            target_language=None, default=None):
                  if target_language is None:
                      preferred = IUserPreferredLanguages(context)
                      target_language = preferred.getPreferredLanguages()[0]
        
                  translations = {'de': u'Hallo Welt',
                                  'nl': u'Hallo Wereld'}
                  return translations.get(target_language, u'Hello World')
        
        Of course, it's silly to implement your own translation domain utility
        if there are already implementations available in ``zope.i18n`` (one
        that reads translations from a GNU gettext message catalog and a
        simple implementation for tests).  Let's try to reuse that
        implementation and register an instance::
        
          import grokcore.component
          from zope.i18n.interfaces import ITranslationDomain
          from zope.i18n.simpletranslationdomain import SimpleTranslationDomain
        
          messages = {('de', u'Hello World'): u'Hallo Welt',
                      ('nl', u'Hello World'): u'Hallo Wereld'}
          helloworld_domain = SimpleTranslationDomain(u'helloworld', messages)
        
          grokcore.component.global_utility(helloworld_domain,
                                            provides=ITranslationDomain,
                                            name='helloworld',
                                            direct=True)
        
        Global adapter
        --------------
        
        Sometimes, you may have an object that should be registered as an adapter
        factory. It may have come from some other framework that configured that
        adapter for you, say, or you may have a class that you instantiate many
        times to get different variations on a particular adapter factory. In these
        cases, subclassing grokcore.component.Adapter or MultiAdapter is not
        possible. Instead, you can use the global_adapter() directive. Here is an
        example drawing on the ``z3c.form`` library, which provides an adapter factory
        factory for named widget attributes::
        
          import zope.interface
          import zope.schema
          import grokcore.component
          import z3c.form.widget import ComputedWidgetAttribute
        
          class ISchema(Interface):
              """This schema will be used to power a z3c.form form"""
        
              field = zope.schema.TextLine(title=u"Sample field")
        
          ...
        
          label_override = z3c.form.widget.StaticWidgetAttribute(
                                u"Override label", field=ISchema['field'])
        
          grokcore.component.global_adapter(label_override, name=u"label")
        
        In the example above, the provided and adapted interfaces are deduced from the
        object returned by the ``StaticWidgetAttribute`` factory. The full syntax
        for global_adapter is::
        
          global_adapter(factory, (IAdapted1, IAdapted2,), IProvided, name=u"name")
        
        The factory must be a callable (the adapter factory). Adapted interfaces are
        given as a tuple. You may use a single interface instead of a one-element
        tuple for single adapters. The provided interface is given as shown. The name
        defaults to u"" (an unnamed adapter).
        
        Handling events
        ---------------
        
        Here we see an event handler much like it occurs within Zope itself. It
        subscribes to the modified event for all annotatable objects (in other words,
        objects that can have metadata associated with them). When invoked, it updates
        the Dublin Core 'Modified' property accordingly::
        
          import datetime
          import grokcore.component
          from zope.annotation.interfaces import IAnnotatable
          from zope.lifecycleevent.interfaces import IObjectModifiedEvent
          from zope.dublincore.interfaces import IZopeDublinCore
        
          @grokcore.component.subscribe(IAnnotatable, IObjectModifiedEvent)
          def updateDublinCoreAfterModification(obj, event):
              """Updated the Dublin Core 'Modified' property when a modified
              event is sent for an object."""
              IZopeDublinCore(obj).modified = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
        
        Subscriptions
        -------------
        
        Subscriptions look similar to Adapter, however, unlike regular adapters,
        subscription adapters are used when we want all of the adapters that adapt an
        object to a particular adapter.
        
        Analogous to MultiAdapter, there is a MultiSubscription component that "adapts"
        multiple objects.
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        2.7 (2016-02-16)
        ----------------
        
        - Add ability to exclude more than one module or package using
          ``<grok:grok exclude="<names>" />`` and allow to use unix shell-style
          wildcards within.
        
        
        2.6.1 (2016-01-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Make grokcore.component.implementer compatible with
          zope.interface.implementer by allowing doing the adapter magic when
          used on functions.
        
        
        2.6 (2015-05-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Compatibility for python 3l
        
        - Python 3 doesn't support the directive ``zope.interface.implements``
          any more and is required to use the ``@implementer`` class decorator instead.
          This version of grokcore.components provides its own
          ``grokcore.component.implements`` directive for both Python 2 and 3.
          So this directive can still be used with the help of a grokker.
          If you use grokcore.components >= 2.6  the new implementation will be used
          while earlier versions used zope.interface.implements.
        
        2.5 (2012-05-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Introduce provideUtility, providerAdapter, provideSubscriptionAdapter,
          provideHandler and provideInterface in grokcore.component. These by default
          delegate the registration of components to the global site manager like
          was done before, but provide the possibility for custom registries for the
          grokked components.
        
        - Fix the `global_adapter` to properly use information annotated by
          ``grok.adapter``, and using the IContext object if it was not
          specified. (Fix Launchpad issue #960097).
        
        - Add a ``key`` option to ``sort_components`` that behave like ``key``
          options available on standard Python sort methods.
        
        2.4 (2011-04-27)
        ----------------
        
        - Fix the `global_adapter` directive implementation to accept an explicit
          "empty" name for nameless adapter registrations (as it used to be that
          providing an empty name in the registration would actually result in
          registering a named adapter in case the factory has a `grok.name`).
        
        2.3 (2011-02-14)
        ----------------
        
        - Implement the generic (Multi)Subscriptions components.
        
        2.2 (2010-11-03)
        ----------------
        
        - The default values computation for the context directive and the provides
          directive is now defined in the directives themselves. This means that where
          the values for these directives is being retrieved, the "default_context"
          function does not need to be passed along anymore for general cases.
        
          Analogous to this, when getting values for the provides directive the
          "default_provides" function does not need to be passed along in the general
          case.
        
        2.1 (2010-11-01)
        ----------------
        
        * Made package comply to zope.org repository policy.
        
        * Moved directives 'order' from grokcore.viewlet and 'path' from
          grokcore.view to this very package.
        
        * Tiny dependency adjustment: moved zope.event to test dependencies.
        
        * Port from 1.x branch exclude parameter to the Grok ZCML directive.
        
        * Port from 1.x branch the ignore of testing.py modules.
        
        2.0 (2009-09-16)
        ----------------
        
        * Use a newer version of Martian that has better support for
          inheritance.  This is demonstrated in ``tests/inherit``.
        
        * The ``ContextGrokker`` and the ``scan.py`` module have gone away
          thanks the newer Martian.
        
        * Directive implementations (in their factory method) should *not*
          bind directives. Directive binding cannot take place at import time,
          but only at grok time. Binding directives during import time (when
          directives are executed) can lead to change problems. (we noticed
          this during our refactoring to use the new Martian).
        
        * Use 1.0b1 versions.cfg in Grok's release info instead of a local
          copy; a local copy for all grokcore packages is just too hard to
          maintain.
        
        1.7 (2009-06-01)
        ----------------
        
        * Add missing provider, global_adapter, implementsOnly, classProvides() to
          the module interface so that they are included in __all__
        
        1.6 (2009-04-10)
        ----------------
        
        * Add convenience imports for implementsOnly() and classProvides() class
          declarations form zope.interface.
        
        * Add support for registering global adapters at module level::
        
            grok.global_adapter(factory, (IAdapted1, IAdapted2,), IProvided, name=u"name")
        
          Only 'factory' is required. If only a single interface is adapted, the
          second argument may be a single interface instead of a tuple. If the
          component has declared adapted/provided interfaces, the second and third
          arguments may be omitted.
        
        * Add support for an @provider decorator to let a function directly provide
          an interface::
        
            @grok.provider(IFoo, IBar)
            def some_function():
                ...
        
          This is equivalent to doing alsoProvides(some_function, IFoo, IBar).
        
        * Add support for named adapters with the @adapter decorator::
        
            @grok.adapter(IAdaptedOne, IAdaptedTwo, name=u"foo")
            def some_function(one, two):
                ...
        
        1.5.1 (2008-07-28)
        ------------------
        
        * The ``IGrokcoreComponentAPI`` interface was missing declarations for
          the ``title`` and ``description`` directives.
        
        1.5 (2008-07-22)
        ----------------
        
        * Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/242353: grokcore.component
          contains old-style test setup. There is no `register_all_tests`
          method in grokcore.component.testing anymore. Use z3c.testsetup
          instead.
        
        * Allow functions that have been marked with @grok.subscribe also be
          registered with ``zope.component.provideHandler()`` manually.  This
          is useful for unit tests where you may not want to grok a whole
          module.
        
        * Document grokcore.component's public API in an interface,
          ``IGrokcoreComponentAPI``.  When you now do::
        
            from grokcore.component import *
        
          only the items documented in that interface will be imported into
          your local namespace.
        
        1.4 (2008-06-11)
        ----------------
        
        * Ported class grokkers to make use of further improvements in Martian.
          This requires Martian 0.10.
        
        1.3 (2008-05-14)
        ----------------
        
        * Ported class grokkers to make use of the new declarative way of
          retrieving directive information from a class.  This requires
          Martian 0.9.6.
        
        1.2.1 (2008-05-04)
        ------------------
        
        * Upgrade to Martian 0.9.5, which has a slight change in the signature of
          ``scan_for_classes``.
        
        * Remove an unnecessary import ``methods_from_class`` from
          ``grokcore.component.scan``.
        
        1.2 (2008-05-04)
        ----------------
        
        * Ported directives to Martian's new directive implementation.  As a
          result, nearly all helper functions that were available from
          ``grokcore.component.util`` have been removed.  The functionality is
          mostly available from the directives themselves now.
        
        * The ``baseclass`` directive has been moved to Martian.
        
        * The ``order`` directive and its helper functions have been moved
          back to Grok, as it was of no general use, but very specific to
          viewlets.
        
        1.1 (2008-05-03)
        ----------------
        
        * ``determine_module_component`` now looks for classes that implement
          a certain interface (such as ``IContext``), instead of taking a list
          of classes.  If looking for ``IContext``, it still will find
          ``Context`` subclasses, as these were also made to implement
          ``IContext``.
        
        * Move the ``public_methods_from_class`` helper function back to Grok,
          it isn't used at all in ``grokcore.component``.
        
        1.0.1 (2008-05-02)
        ------------------
        
        * The grokkers for adapters and global utilities did not use the
          correct value for the *provided* interface in the configuration
          action discriminator.  Because of this, uninformative and
          potentially wrong conflict errors would occur, as well as no
          conflict where a conflict should have occurred.
        
        * The grokker for the ``global_utility()`` directive did immediate
          registrations instead of generating configuration actions.
          Therefore it did not provoke ``ConflictErrors`` for conflicting
          registrations.
        
        * Improved documentation
        
        1.0 (2008-05-01)
        ----------------
        
        * Created ``grokcore.component`` in March 2008 by factoring basic
          component base classes and their directives and grokkers out of
          Grok.
