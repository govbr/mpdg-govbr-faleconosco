Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ``plone.resource`` publishes directories of static files via the ZPublisher.
        These directories may be located either in the ZODB (as OFS folders and files), or on the filesystem.
        
        Each resource directory has a type and a name. When combined, these are used to traverse to the resource directory.
        For example::
        
            /++theme++mytheme/<subpath>
            /++sitelayout++mylayout/<subpath>
            /++templatelayout++mylayout<subpath>
        
        
        Where resources can be stored
        -----------------------------
        
        Resource directory contents can be found by the traverser in several different places.
        The following locations are tried in order.
        
        Files in the ZODB
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Installing ``plone.resource`` creates a Zope-folder called ``portal_resources``.
        It can be used to store resource directories persistently.
        By convention:
        
        - the top-level folders under this folder correspond to resource types,
        - the second-level folders correspond to the resource directory name.
        
        So, the file traversable at ``/++theme++mytheme/myfile`` could be physically located at ``some_site/++etc++site/resources/theme/mytheme``
        
        .. TODO (XXX: provide a helper to upload a tarball/zip)
        
        
        Files in Python distributions
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        A folder in a Python distribution (e.g. egg) can be registered as a resource directory of a particular type and name using the ``plone:static`` ZCML directive.
        For example, this registers a directory named "theme" as a resource directory of type "theme" under the name "mytheme".
        It would be accessible at ``++theme++mytheme``::
        
            <plone:static
                directory="theme"
                type="theme"
                name="mytheme"
            />
        
          .. note::
             You must do ``<include package="plone.resource" file="meta.zcml"/>``
             before you can use the plone:static directive.
        
        The name of the resource directory defaults to the name of the package, so can be omitted.
        E.g. the following directive in a package named "mytheme" would result in the same registration as above::
        
            <plone:static
                directory="resources"
                type="theme"
            />
        
        Traversing upward in directory paths using ``..`` is not supported for security reasons, as it could allow unwanted file access.
        
        Minimum zcml config example
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        ::
        
            <configure xmlns:plone="http://namespaces.plone.org/plone">
              <include package="plone.resource" file="meta.zcml"/>
              <plone:static
                  directory="resources"
                  type="theme"
                  name="myproject"
                />
            </configure>
        
            ..
        
        Files in a central resource directory
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        If the ``plone:static`` directive is used from ``site.zcml`` (i.e., with no active package in the ZCML import context),
        then it may specify the absolute path to a top-level resources directory.
        
        This directory should have the same sub-directory structure as explained above (in-ZODB resources directory):
        
        - the top-level folders under this folder correspond to resource types,
        - the second-level folders correspond to the resource directory name.
        
        In addition, in order for resources to be available, the top-level directories *require a traverser* to be registered!
        
        For example, the following in ``site.zcml`` registers the given path within the buildout root::
        
            <plone:static
                directory="/path/to/buildout/resources"
            />
        
        In order to automate this at buildout time, `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_  recipe has the option ``resources``.
        It injects the above zcml snippet with into ``site.zcml`` by specifying the option like this::
        
              [instance]
              ...
              resources = ${buildout:directory}/resources
              ...
        
        Example:
        Using ``plone.app.theming`` - which provides the ``++theme++`` traverser - given an image file located in filesystem at::
        
            ${buildout:directory}/resources/theme/my.project/logo.png``
        
        This would be traversable at a URL like so::
        
            http://localhost:8080/Plone/++theme++my.project/logo.png
        
        .. _`plone.recipe.zope2instance`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.recipe.zope2instance
        
        Additional traversers
        ---------------------
        
        Custom traversers can be registered via ZCML using an adapter like so::
        
            <adapter
                name="demo"
                for="* zope.publisher.interfaces.IRequest"
                provides="zope.traversing.interfaces.ITraversable"
                factory="my.project.traversal.MyTraverser"
            />
        
        with a corresponding simple factory definition of::
        
            from plone.resource.traversal import ResourceTraverser
            class MyTraverser(ResourceTraverser):
                name = 'demo'
        
        This, when coupled with configuration like that in the `Files in a central resource directory`_ section above, would mean that resources located at::
        
            ${buildout:directory}/resources/demo/my.project/logo.png
        
        would be traversable at a URL like so::
        
            http://localhost:8080/Plone/++demo++my.project/logo.png
