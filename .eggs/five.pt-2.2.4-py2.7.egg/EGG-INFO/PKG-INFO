Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This package brings the Chameleon template engine to the Zope application
        server.
        
        It works using monkey-patching onto the existing API (specifically,
        the ``TALInterpreter`` and ``PageTemplate`` classes). In simple terms,
        what the patching does is to replace the TAL interpreter class and
        make sure that the so-called "cooking" routine uses the Chameleon
        parser and compiler instead of the ``zope.*`` reference
        implementation.
        
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        To enable Chameleon, configure the package using ZCML::
        
          <include package="five.pt" />
        
        For more information on Chameleon, see http://www.pagetemplates.org/.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.2.4 (2016-04-19)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Skip processing instruction code blocks in templates that use
          the restricted evaluation engine.
          [mauritsvanrees]
        
        
        2.2.3 (2015-07-18)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Add version to setup.py to make zest.releaser happy.
          [timo]
        
        - Compatibility with Chameleon >= 2.14
          [tomgross]
        
        
        2.2.2 (2014-04-15)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fix test.
          [davisagli]
        
        
        2.2.1 (2012-01-08)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Features:
        
        - Whitespace between attributes is now reduced to a single whitespace
          character.
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - The path traverser now correctly renders callables, applying the
          template namespace as keyword arguments. Previously, only the
          ``request`` name would be passed.
        
        - The content provider expression now correctly applies TAL namespace
          data.
        
        - Avoid duplicate HTML decoding. This fixes an issue which was
          introduced because newer Chameleon releases decode all expression
          inputs by default.
        
        2.2.0 (2011-10-10)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Update implementation to use component-based template engine
          configuration, plugging directly into the Zope Toolkit framework.
        
        - Declare RepeatItem as public object with allowed subobjects
          [leorochael]
        
        - Bump minimum versions of dependencies z3c.pt and sourcecodegen to fix
          lp#853731 and lp#848200.
          [leorochael]
        
        - Fixed encoding issue with restricted Python expression. The Python
          2.4 AST parser does not accept unicode input and the expression
          string must be explicitly encoded to a byte string.
          [malthe]
        
        2.1.5 (2011-08-11)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Reuse template instance on cook.
          [malthe]
        
        - Use the template source string available in the ``_text`` attribute
          instead of reading the file (again).
          [leorochael, malthe]
        
        - Use secure moduler importer for both Zope 2 and 3 templates. This
          fixes issue #34.
          [malthe]
        
        2.1.4 (2011-07-28)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Upgrade to newest Zope integration package.
        
        2.1.3 (2011-07-23)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed issue with traversal and dictionary optimization (the
          optimization has been removed).
          [malthe]
        
        - Fixed compatibility issue with the ``UnauthorizedBinding`` class and
          traversal.
          [malthe]
        
        2.1.2 (2011-07-21)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Wire in restricted python builtins as imports. Previously these were
          added to the dynamic context.
          [malthe]
        
        - Use the Python expression from the ``z3c.pt`` package for the
          trusted page template engine. This difference between this and the
          standard Python expression from Chameleon is that the pipe character
          (``"|"``) has the meaning of fallback in Chameleon, but not in the
          reference ZPT implementation (where it's only available for path
          expressions).
          [malthe]
        
        2.1.1 (2011-07-15)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added builtins from ``RestrictedPython`` to context for Zope 2
          templates.
        
          This fixes name error issues on templates that use one or more
          utility function builtins normally available to Python expressions
          in restricted mode.
          [malthe]
        
        2.1 (2011-07-14)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Point release.
        
        - Use trusted path expression for trusted expression engine.
          [malthe]
        
        - Fixed template context issues where a ``request`` would be required
          by the path expression compiler but not provided (typically when in
          a situation where the user is unauthorized to view content).
          [malthe]
        
        2.1-rc1 (2011-07-14)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Major architectural change.
        
          The package no longer contains own template classes; instead,
          patches are made to switch from the reference TAL interpreter to the
          Chameleon TAL compiler.
          [malthe]
        
        2.0-rc3 (2011-07-07)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Refactor custom Python expression implementation to use the
          ``parse`` method. This builds directly on the base implementation
          and its behavior.
          [malthe]
        
        2.0-rc2 (2011-05-24)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Have the base template class implement ``IPageTemplate`` from
          ``zope.pagetemplate``. This interface is relied on for a number of
          adapter registrations and the missing interface declaration affects
          packages such as ``plone.caching``.
          [malthe]
        
        - Set default reload mode to the Zope 2 application server
          configuration's ``debug_mode`` value.
          [malthe]
        
        2.0-rc1 (2011-02-28)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Update to Chameleon 2.0.
        
          This release includes many changes and is a complete rewrite of the
          1.x series.
        
          Note that Python 2.5+ is now required.
          [malthe]
        
        - Python-expressions are now subject to access-control security.
          [malthe]
        
        1.3.3 - 2010-09-30
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Apply patches at import time instead of product initialisation.
          [wichert]
        
        1.3.2 - 2010-09-29
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Add a same_type method to the default namespace.
          [wichert]
        
        1.3.1 - 2010-09-23
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added support for eager loading (environment variable
          ``CHAMELEON_EAGER``). This flag should be passed only in development
          mode and will reveal any templates which do not parse.
          [malthe]
        
        1.3 - 2010-09-08
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added support for ``PageTemplate`` and
          ``ZopePageTemplate``.
          [malthe]
        
        1.2 - 2010-08-30
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed acquisition-wrapping issue: we need to wrap with the parent to
          avoid a pair of template objects (original and patched).
        
        1.1 - 2010-05-15
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Add DateTime to the base context. Fixes problems with certain ZMI pages.
          [wichert]
        
        1.0 - 2010-05-13
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - If template is not an acquirer, wrap it implicitly. [malthe]
        
        - Removed unused ``ViewletManager`` ZCML handler. [malthe]
        
        0.10 - 2010-04-20
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Improve five.grok support [fretin]
        
        - Check if templates are acquisition-aware before trying to wrap them. This
          fixes problems with METAL macros in some ZMI pages. [wichert]
        
        0.9 - 2010-04-14
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Basic support for five.grok templates. [wichert]
        
        0.8 - 2010-01-05
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed some calling convention oddity that would result in the view
          instance being passed doubly as the template arguments.
        
        0.7 - 2009-05-20
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Default encoding of the base template set to UTF-8. [malthe]
        
        - Update to latest Chameleon. [malthe]
        
        - Patch ``macros`` attribute. [malthe]
        
        0.6 - 2009-04-06
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Avoid another case of unconditionally attempting to Acquisition wrap
          template files. We do have an interface check for this. [hannosch]
        
        0.5 - 2009-02-17
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added test function to template context. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed edge-case (special case?) where the view of a
          ViewPageTemplateFile is really only the view for a view. [malthe]
        
        - Added patch for ``Products.PageTemplates.PageTemplateFile``. [malthe]
        
        - Rework the "full namespace provided to path expression" change introduced
          in 0.3. We no longer call the expensive locals() function but construct a
          minimal namespace with the context and request ourselves. [hannosch]
        
        - If the ``__get__`` method is called uninstantiated, just return the
          class itself. [malthe]
        
        five.pt 0.4 (released 2/13/2009)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Fixed issue where the ``template`` parameter to a viewlet manager
          directive was effectively ignored. [malthe]
        
        - Fixed acquisition-wrapping issue with the (patched) bound template
          class (could cause infinite loop due to cyclic acquisition
          chain). [malthe]
        
        - Moved evaluate_path and evaluate_exists over to ``z3c.pt``, adding
          support for global ``path()`` and ``exists()`` functions for use in
          ``python:`` expressions to it (LP #317967). [sidnei]
        
        five.pt 0.3 (released 12/17/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Use bobo traversal if ``OFS.interfaces.ITraversable`` interface is
          provided. [malthe]
        
        - Adjusted the path expression to provide the full namespace to the render
          function and not just the request. This matches Zope2 behavior. [hannosch]
        
        five.pt 0.2 (released 11/29/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - From Zope 2.12 onwards, do not acquisition-wrap content
          provider. [malthe]
        
        - Split out CMF-related code to separate package. [malthe]
        
        - Compatibility changes to support Zope 2.10. [malthe]
        
        five.pt 0.1 (released 11/19/2008)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Initial release.
        
        - Simplified template class inheritance. [malthe]
        
        - Added ``path`` and ``exists`` functions to skin template
          namespace. [malthe]
        
        - Added call-support for old-style classes in path
          expressions. [malthe]
        
        - Added monkey-patches to replace template engine for module-level
          view page template instances. [malthe]
        
        - Made `EContext` class more robust. [malthe]
        
        - Register custom file-system page template class for use with CMF
          form controllers. [malthe]
        
        - Register custom file-system page template class for use with CMF
          directory views. [malthe]
        
        - Added meta-directives to register browser views, viewlets and
          viewlet managers using Chameleon templates. [malthe]
        
        - Updated to latest API. [malthe]
        
        - Package structure. [hannosch]
