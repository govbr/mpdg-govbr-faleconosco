Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package contains fields and wrapper objects for storing:
        
        * A file with a filename
        * An image with a filename
        
        Blob-based and non-blob-based types are provided. The blob-based types
        require the ZODB3 package to be at version 3.8.1 or later,
        and BLOBs to be configured in zope.conf.
        
        plone.supermodel handlers are registered.
        
        See the ``usage.rst`` doctest for more details.

        ----------------
        
        Incompatibilities:
        
        - Targets Plone 5.1 only, coredev 5.0 and 4.3 are on 3.0.x branch [jensens]:
        
          - ``plone.supermodel``, ``plone.scale`` and ``plone.schemaeditor`` are now hard depedencies.
            The extras  in setup.py are kept for bbb reasons, but are empty.
            Conditional code is now no longer conditional.
            This simplifies the code a lot.
        
          - ``zope.app.file`` is no longer hard dependency.
            If it is there, its FileChunk implementation is still checked for, otherwise not.
        
        
        New:
        
        - uses adapter as factory for scales as in plone.scale>=1.5
          [jensens]
        
        Fixes:
        
        - Several tests were failing on Windows 10 due to binary files being opened in text mode. Fixed.
          [smcmahon]
        
        - Prevent attempt to create a filestream_iterator from a temporary file associated with an
          uncommited blob.
          Fixes an error on Windows 10 "WindowsError 32" by attempting to delete or access a file in use
          by another process.
          [smcmahon]
        
        - Fix tests to work with latest plone.scale changes, where gif images are no longer converted to jpeg.
          [thet]
        
        - Fixed test setup to use layers properly.
          [jensens]
        
        - Fixed test isolation problem in ``test_blobfile.py``.
          [jensens]
        
        - Fix warning on testing.zcml missing an i18n:domain.
          [gforcada]
        
        - Fix some code analysis warnings.
          [gforcada]
        
        3.0.8 (2016-02-26)
        ------------------
        
        Fixes:
        
        - PEP 8, UTF-8 headers, implements/adapts to decorators, doctest formating.
          [thet, jensens]
        
        - Workarround for method getImageSize.
          Prevent returning (-1, -1) as the size of the image.
          [andreesg]
        
        
        3.0.7 (2016-02-12)
        ------------------
        
        Fixes:
        
        - Make plone.protect a soft dependency. This allows to use this package in
          setups without the Plone stack. Fixes plone/Products.CMFPlone#1311
          [thet]
        
        3.0.6 (2016-01-08)
        ------------------
        
        Fixes:
        
        - Stabilised tests.  [gotcha]

          [maurits]
        
        
        3.0.4 (2015-10-28)
        ------------------
        
        Fixes:
        
        - No longer rely on deprecated ``bobobase_modification_time`` from
          ``Persistence.Persistent``.
          [thet]
        
        
        3.0.3 (2015-08-14)
        ------------------
        
        - Don't fail, when accessing the ``tag`` method of the ``@@images`` view, if
          ``scale`` returns ``None``.
          [thet]
        
        
        3.0.2 (2015-03-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Cache image scales using the plone.stableResource ruleset when they are
          accessed via UID-based URLs. (Requires plone.app.imaging >= 1.1.0)
          [davisagli]
        
        
        3.0.1 (2014-10-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed inserting filename in Content-Disposition header.

          [jensens]
        
        - Internationalize field factory label.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        
        3.0.0 (2014-04-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Disable CSRF protection when creating a scale so we can write to the database
          [vangheem]
        
        
        2.0.5 (2014-02-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Ensure zope.app.file.file module alias is created before its use in
          file package.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        
        2.0.4 (2014-01-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Disable CSRF protection when creating a scale so we can write to the database
          [vangheem]
        
        - Validate image field : check if content is actually an image using mimetype.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Fix: get_contenttype works when empty string is given as contentType.
        
        - Backward compatibility of NamedFile with zope.app.file FileChunk.
          Avoids NamedFile validation unexpected failures.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        
        2.0.5 (2014-02-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Ensure zope.app.file.file module alias is created before its use in
          file package.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        
        2.0.4 (2014-01-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Backward compatibility of NamedFile with zope.app.file FileChunk.
          Avoids NamedFile validation unexpected failures.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Validate image field : check if content is actually an image using mimetype.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Fix: get_contenttype works when empty string is given as contentType.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        
        2.0.3 (2013-12-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Scaling Traverser now does not try to traverse two steps in one.
          This is impossible in chameleon.
          [do3cc]
        
        
        2.0.2 (2013-05-23)
        ------------------
        
        * Use plone.app.imaging's (>=1.0.8) quality setting if it exists.
          https://dev.plone.org/ticket/13337
          [khink]
        
        * fix invalidation on contexts that do not implement dublin core; Notably
          portlet assignments. Fallback is bobo_modification_time. Maybe portlet
          assignments should implement modified() instead?
          [tmog]
        
        * Fixed handling of TTW Dexterity content type image field
          data when image data is large and stored as
          zope.app.file.file.FileChunk in ZODB instead of raw string data.
          Issue appearated after Plone 4.3 migration [miohtama]
        
        
        2.0.1 (2013-01-17)
        ------------------
        
        * Add direction parameter support in scaling (was ignored in tag and scale
          functions).
          Now calling tag function with parameter direction='down' crops the image.
          direction='thumbnail' by default so default behaviour remains the same.
          [jriboux]
        
        2.0 (2012-08-29)
        ----------------
        
        * Move file and image value implementations here instead of extending
          the ones from zope.app.file and z3c.blobfile. This helps tame a mess
          of dependencies.
          [davisagli]
        
        * The blob-based file and image implementations are now always available.
          (But they will only work if Zope is using a storage with blob support.)
          [davisagli]
        
        * Add support for HEAD requests to @@images view
          [anthonygerrard]
        
        * Add hook to override headers in subclasses of file download view
          [anthonygerrard]
        
        * Don't set filename in header if filename contains non ascii chars.
          [do3cc]
        
        * Adding Dexterity Image caused TypeError if jpeg file contained
          corrupt metadata. Closes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12753.

        1.0.5 - 2011-09-24
        ------------------
        
        * Make the ``download`` view respect custom read permissions for the field
          being downloaded, rather than only checking the view permission for the
          object as a whole.
          [davisagli]
        
        1.0.4 - 2011-08-21
        ------------------
        
        * Fix bug in producing tag for a scale on an item whose title has non-ASCII
          characters.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Make sure image scales of allowed attributes can be accessed on disallowed
          containers.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Add unit tests for safe_filename, since not exercised within this module.
          (should be moved to plone.formwidget.namedfile?)
          [lentinj]
        
        1.0.3 - 2011-05-20

        ------------------
        
        * In the tag method of ImageScale to allow height/width/alt/title to be
          omitted when they are supplied as a None argument.
          [elro]
        
        * In marshalled file fields, encode the filename parameter of the
          Content-Disposition header in accordance with RFC 2231. This ensures that
          filenames with non-ASCII characters can be successfully demarshalled.
          [davisagli]
        
        * Make the various file classes be strict about only accepting unicode
          filenames.
          [davisagli]

        * Declare dependency on plone.rfc822 >= 1.0b2 (for IPrimaryField).
          [davisagli]
        
        * Add a @@display-file view which doesn't set Content-Disposition, so we don't
          force download of images, for example.
          [lentinj]
        
        1.0b7 - 2011-03-22
        ------------------
        
        * Support getting the original size as a scale.
          [elro]
        
        * Add tag() method to scaling view.
          [elro]
        
        * Scaling: quote values of extra tag attributes.
          [elro]
        
        1.0b6 - 2011-02-11
        ------------------

          [davisagli]
        
        * Fix the field schemata so they can be used as the form schema when
          adding the field using plone.schemaeditor.
          [rossp]
        
        1.0b4 - 2009-11-17
        ------------------
        
        * Avoid using the internal _current_filename() helper, which disappeared in
          ZODB 3.9.
          [optilude]
        
        * Add field factories for plone.schemaeditor (only installed if
          plone.schemaeditor is available)

        ------------------
        
        * Make z3c.blobfile (and blobs in general) a soft dependency. You'll need to
          separately depend on z3c.blobfile (and probably pin it to versio 0.1.2) to
          get the NamedBlobFile and NamedBlobImage fields. This means that
          plone.namedfile can be used with ZODB versions that do not support BLOBs.
          This policy will probably be revisited for a 2.0 release.

        Usage
        =====
        
        This demonstrates how to use the package.
        
        Schema fields
        -------------
        
        The following schema fields can be used to describe file data. We'll only
        test the BLOB versions of the fields if z3c.blobfile is installed::
        
            >>> from zope.interface import Interface
            >>> from plone.namedfile import field
        
            >>> class IFileContainer(Interface):
            ...     simple = field.NamedFile(title=u"Named file")
            ...     image = field.NamedImage(title=u"Named image file")
            ...     blob = field.NamedBlobFile(title=u"Named blob file")
            ...     blobimage = field.NamedBlobImage(title=u"Named blob image file")
        
        These store data with the following types::
        
            >>> from zope.interface import implementer
            >>> from plone import namedfile
        
        
            >>> @implementer(IFileContainer)
            ... class FileContainer(object):
            ...     __allow_access_to_unprotected_subobjects__ = 1
            ...     def __init__(self):
            ...         self.simple = namedfile.NamedFile()
            ...         self.image = namedfile.NamedImage()
            ...         self.blob = namedfile.NamedBlobFile()
            ...         self.blobimage = namedfile.NamedBlobImage()
        
        
        File data and content type
        --------------------------
        
        Let's now show how to get and set file data.
        
        The FileContainer class creates empty objects to start with::
        
            >>> container = FileContainer()
        
            >>> container.simple.data
            ''
            >>> container.simple.contentType
            ''
            >>> container.simple.filename is None
            True
        
            >>> container.image.data
            ''
            >>> container.image.contentType
            ''
            >>> container.image.filename is None
            True
        
            >>> container.blob.data
            ''
            >>> container.blob.contentType
            ''
            >>> container.blob.filename is None
            True
            >>> container.blobimage.data
            ''
            >>> container.blobimage.contentType
            ''
            >>> container.blobimage.filename is None
            True
        
        Let's now set some actual data in these files. Notice how the constructor
        will attempt to guess the filename from the file extension::
        
            >>> container.simple = namedfile.NamedFile('dummy test data', filename=u"test.txt")
            >>> container.simple.data
            'dummy test data'
            >>> container.simple.contentType
            'text/plain'
            >>> container.simple.filename
            u'test.txt'
        
            >>> container.blob = namedfile.NamedBlobFile('dummy test data', filename=u"test.txt")
            >>> container.blob.data
            'dummy test data'
            >>> container.blob.contentType
            'text/plain'
            >>> container.blob.filename
            u'test.txt'
        
        Let's also try to read a GIF, courtesy of the zope.app.file tests::
        
            >>> zptlogo = (
            ...     'GIF89a\x10\x00\x10\x00\xd5\x00\x00\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xfe\xfc\xfd\xfd'
            ...     '\xfa\xfb\xfc\xf7\xf9\xfa\xf5\xf8\xf9\xf3\xf6\xf8\xf2\xf5\xf7\xf0\xf4\xf6'
            ...     '\xeb\xf1\xf3\xe5\xed\xef\xde\xe8\xeb\xdc\xe6\xea\xd9\xe4\xe8\xd7\xe2\xe6'
            ...     '\xd2\xdf\xe3\xd0\xdd\xe3\xcd\xdc\xe1\xcb\xda\xdf\xc9\xd9\xdf\xc8\xd8\xdd'

            ...     '\xbd\xd1\xd8\xbd\xd0\xd7\xbc\xcf\xd7\xbb\xcf\xd6\xbb\xce\xd5\xb9\xcd\xd4'
            ...     '\xb6\xcc\xd4\xb6\xcb\xd3\xb5\xcb\xd2\xb4\xca\xd1\xb2\xc8\xd0\xb1\xc7\xd0'
            ...     '\xb0\xc7\xcf\xaf\xc6\xce\xae\xc4\xce\xad\xc4\xcd\xab\xc3\xcc\xa9\xc2\xcb'
            ...     '\xa8\xc1\xca\xa6\xc0\xc9\xa4\xbe\xc8\xa2\xbd\xc7\xa0\xbb\xc5\x9e\xba\xc4'
            ...     '\x9b\xbf\xcc\x98\xb6\xc1\x8d\xae\xbaFgs\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'

            ...     '\x00A\x00;'
            ...     )
        
            >>> container.image = namedfile.NamedImage(zptlogo, filename=u"zpt.gif")
            >>> container.image.data == zptlogo
            True
            >>> container.image.contentType
            'image/gif'
            >>> container.image.filename
            u'zpt.gif'
        
            >>> container.blobimage = namedfile.NamedBlobImage(zptlogo, filename=u"zpt.gif")
            >>> container.blobimage.data == zptlogo
            True
            >>> container.blobimage.contentType
            'image/gif'
            >>> container.blobimage.filename
            u'zpt.gif'
        
        Note that is possible for force the mimetype::
        
            >>> container.image = namedfile.NamedImage(zptlogo, contentType='image/foo', filename=u"zpt.gif")
            >>> container.image.data == zptlogo
            True
            >>> container.image.contentType
            'image/foo'
            >>> container.image.filename
            u'zpt.gif'
        
            >>> container.blobimage = namedfile.NamedBlobImage(zptlogo, contentType='image/foo', filename=u"zpt.gif")
            >>> container.blobimage.data == zptlogo
            True
            >>> container.blobimage.contentType
            'image/foo'
            >>> container.blobimage.filename
            u'zpt.gif'
        
        The filename must be set to a unicode string, not a bytestring::
        
            >>> container.image.filename = 'foo'
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            WrongType: ('foo', <type 'unicode'>, 'filename')
        
        
        Download view
        -------------
        
        This package also comes with a view that can be used to download files. This
        will set Content-Disposition to ensure the browser downloads the file rather
        than displaying it. To use it, link to ../context-object/@@download/fieldname,
        where `fieldname` is the name of the attribute on the context-object where the
        named file is stored.
        
        We will test this with a dummy request, faking traversal::
        
            >>> from plone.namedfile.browser import Download
            >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
        
            >>> request = TestRequest()
            >>> download = Download(container, request).publishTraverse(request, 'simple')
            >>> download()
            'dummy test data'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
            '15'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Type')
            'text/plain'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Disposition')
            "attachment; filename*=UTF-8''test.txt"
        
            >>> request = TestRequest()
            >>> download = Download(container, request).publishTraverse(request, 'blob')
            >>> data = download()
            >>> hasattr(data, 'read') and data.read() or data
            'dummy test data'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
            '15'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Type')
            'text/plain'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Disposition')
            "attachment; filename*=UTF-8''test.txt"
        
            >>> request = TestRequest()
            >>> download = Download(container, request).publishTraverse(request, 'image')
            >>> download() == zptlogo
            True
        
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
            '341'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Type')
            'image/foo'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Disposition')
            "attachment; filename*=UTF-8''zpt.gif"
        
            >>> request = TestRequest()
            >>> download = Download(container, request).publishTraverse(request, 'blobimage')
            >>> data = download()
            >>> (hasattr(data, 'read') and data.read() or data) == zptlogo
            True
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
            '341'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Type')
            'image/foo'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Disposition')
            "attachment; filename*=UTF-8''zpt.gif"
        
        
        Display-file view
        -----------------
        
        This package also comes with a view that can be used to display files in the
        browser. To use it, link to ../context-object/@@display-file/fieldname, where
        `fieldname` is the name of the attribute on the context-object where the named
        file is stored.
        
        We will test this with a dummy request, faking traversal::
        
            >>> from plone.namedfile.browser import DisplayFile
            >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
        
            >>> request = TestRequest()
            >>> display_file = DisplayFile(container, request).publishTraverse(request, 'simple')
            >>> display_file()
            'dummy test data'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
            '15'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Type')
            'text/plain'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Disposition')
        
            >>> request = TestRequest()
            >>> display_file = DisplayFile(container, request).publishTraverse(request, 'blob')
            >>> data = display_file()
            >>> hasattr(data, 'read') and data.read() or data
            'dummy test data'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
            '15'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Type')
            'text/plain'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Disposition')
        
            >>> request = TestRequest()
            >>> display_file = DisplayFile(container, request).publishTraverse(request, 'image')
            >>> display_file() == zptlogo
            True
        
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
            '341'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Type')
            'image/foo'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Disposition')
        
            >>> request = TestRequest()
            >>> display_file = DisplayFile(container, request).publishTraverse(request, 'blobimage')
            >>> data = display_file()
            >>> (hasattr(data, 'read') and data.read() or data) == zptlogo
            True
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
            '341'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Type')
            'image/foo'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Disposition')
        
        
        Specifying the primary field
        ----------------------------
        
        To use the @@download view without specifying the field in the URL, the
        primary field information must be registered with an adapter. (Frameworks such
        as plone.dexterity may already have done this for you.)::
        
            >>> from plone.rfc822.interfaces import IPrimaryFieldInfo
            >>> from zope.component import adapter
        
            >>> @implementer(IPrimaryFieldInfo)
            ... @adapter(IFileContainer)
            ... class FieldContainerPrimaryFieldInfo(object):
            ...     fieldname = 'simple'
            ...     field = IFileContainer['simple']
            ...     def __init__(self, context):
            ...         self.value = context.simple
        
            >>> from zope.component import getSiteManager
            >>> components = getSiteManager()
            >>> components.registerAdapter(FieldContainerPrimaryFieldInfo)
        
        We will test this with a dummy request, faking traversal::
        
            >>> request = TestRequest()
            >>> download = Download(container, request)
            >>> download()
            'dummy test data'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
            '15'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Type')
            'text/plain'
            >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Disposition')
            "attachment; filename*=UTF-8''test.txt"
        
        
        Image scales
        ------------
        
        This package can handle the creation, storage, and retrieval of arbitrarily
        sized scaled versions of images stored in NamedImage or NamedBlobImage fields.
        
        Image scales are accessed via an @@images view that is available for any item
        providing ``plone.namedfile.interfaces.IImageScaleTraversable``.  There are
        several ways that you may reference scales from page templates.
        
        1. for full control you may do the tag generation explicitly::
        
             <img tal:define="scales context/@@images;
                              thumbnail python: scales.scale('image', width=64, height=64);"
                  tal:condition="thumbnail"
                  tal:attributes="src thumbnail/url;
                                  width thumbnail/width;
                                  height thumbnail/height" />
        
           This would create an up to 64 by 64 pixel scaled down version of the image
           stored in the "image" field.  It also allows for passing in additional
           parameters support by `plone.scale`_'s ``scaleImage`` function, e.g.
           ``direction`` or ``quality``.
        
           .. _`plone.scale`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.scale
        
        2. for automatic tag generation with extra parameters you would use::
        
             <img tal:define="scale context/@@images"
                  tal:replace="structure python: scale.scale('image',
                               width=1200, height=800, direction='down').tag()" />
        
        3. It is possible to access scales via predefined named scale sizes, rather
           than hardcoding the dimensions every time you access a scale.  The scale
           sizes are found via calling a utility providing
           ``plone.namedfile.interfaces.IAvailableSizes``, which should return a dict of
           scale name => (width, height).  A scale called 'mini' could then be accessed
           like this::
        
             <img tal:define="scale context/@@images"
                  tal:replace="structure python: scale.scale('image',
                               scale='mini').tag()" />
        
           This would use the predefined scale size "mini" to determine the desired
           image dimensions, but still allow to pass in extra parameters.
        
        4. a convenience short-cut for option 3 can be used::
        
             <img tal:replace="structure context/@@images/image/mini" />
        
        5. and lastly, the short-cut can also be used to render the unscaled image::
        
             <img tal:replace="structure context/@@images/image" />
