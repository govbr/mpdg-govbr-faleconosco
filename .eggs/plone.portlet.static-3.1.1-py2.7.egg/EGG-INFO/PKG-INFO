        3.1.1 (2017-07-03)
        ------------------
        
        Bug fixes:
        
        - Remove unittest2 dependency
          [kakshay21]
        
        
        3.1 (2016-09-07)
        ----------------
        
        New:
        
        - Attempt to use AutoExtensibleForm for as base for static portlet forms
          when Plone 4 site also has recent plone.app.widgets; this should be
          consistent in portlet with how TinyMCE is configured for Dexterity
          content.  This approach attempts to harmonize Plone 4 compatibillity
          work done previously by @thet and @cdw9 -- supporting Plone 4, either
          with/without plone.app.widgets, and with/without plone.app.contenttypes
          (provided recent plone.app.widgets is used).

        3.0.2 (2016-02-14)
        ------------------
        
        Fixes:
        
        - Cleaned up test setup.
          [timo]
        
        - Check that renderer has a '__portlet_metadata__' attribute
          and compute 'assignment context' only for 'context' portlet.
          [sverbois]
        
        - Plone 4 compatibility.
          [thet]
        
        
        3.0.1 (2014-10-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Replace DL/DT/DD in portlet with more semantic markup (see PR #7).
          [khink]
        
        - Fix the relative url transformation.
          The 'safe_html' transformation has to be called with 'assignment context'
          instead of 'display context'.
          [sverbois]
        
        
        3.0.0 (2014-04-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Use z3c.form for the portlet forms.

        2.0.2 (2013-01-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Check if instance is str before turning to unicode as Portal_tranform itself
          can return unicode
          [fafhrd91]
        
        - Portlet title no longer required. If the title is empty, the css class
          "titleless" is added to the header.
          [rnix, thet]
        
        - Adding constraint to validate white spaces
          Fix https://dev.plone.org/ticket/13130

          [WouterVH]
        
        - Add metadata.xml to profile.
          [WouterVH]
        
        
        2.0.1 - 2011-01-03
        ------------------
        
        - Add Site Administrator to the default roles for the
          "plone.portlet.static: Add static portlet" permission, for forward
          compatibility with Plone 4.1.
          [davisagli]
        
        
        2.0 - 2010-07-18
        ----------------
        
        - Removed the deprecated `hide` option form the portlet.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Update license to GPL version 2 only.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        2.0b2 - 2010-02-17
        ------------------
        
        - Removed the transformation cache from the portlet renderer. Portal transforms
          doesn't actually work with the assignment class as a cache context.
          This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10167.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        2.0b1 - 2009-12-02
        ------------------
        
        - Removed Kupu as a testing dependency. In Plone 4 the tests work with the
          default TinyMCE transforms.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        2.0a2 - 2009-11-18
        ------------------
        
        - Removed reference to non-existent profile in plone.app.portlets.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        2.0a1 - 2009-11-13
        ------------------
        
        - Remove the "hide" option as this is now available to all portlets (PLIP 9286)
          [igbun]
        
        - Adjusted test setup to Plone 5.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added the z3c.autoinclude entry point so this package is automatically loaded
          on Plone 3.3 and above.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Declare test dependencies in an extra.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Specify package dependencies.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added 'tile' CSS class to the links within dt.portletHeader and
          dd.portletFooter for static portlet's template
          [spliter]
        
        
        1.2.1 - 2009-11-25
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed a syntax error introduced in the last change.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.2 - 2009-11-25
        ----------------
        
        - Ensure that text output is passed through the safe-html transform to protect
          against malicious text. This also ensures the resolve uid behavior works when
          only TinyMCE and not Kupu is installed.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed msgids in portlets.xml. There is no support for
          msgids in the import of portlets.xml implementation.
          This allows to extract translatable strings with i18ndude.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Added transform to resolve uids.
          [lrowe]
        
        
        1.2rc1 - 2009-03-27
        -------------------
        
        - The portlet was incorrectly using the 'Manage portlet' permission. It now
          uses a custom permission with the same default roles.
          Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8403.
          [optilude]
        
        
        1.1.5 - 2008-08-18
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed a typo in CSS class name. This closes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8119.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.1.2 -  2008-06-01
        -------------------
        
        - Added more i18n in the main python file as the i18n in portlets.xml
          is not used.  [maurits]
        
        - Added option to (temporarily) hide the portlet without needing to
          delete it.  [maurits]
        
        
        1.1.0 - 2008-04-20
