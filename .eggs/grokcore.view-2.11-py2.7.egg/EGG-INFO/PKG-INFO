        Setting up ``grokcore.view``
        ============================
        
        This package is essentially set up like the `grokcore.component`_
        package, please refer to its documentation for details.  The
        additional ZCML line you will need is::
        
          <include package="grokcore.view" file="meta.zcml" />
          <include package="grokcore.view" />
        
        Put the first line somewhere near the top of your root ZCML file (but
        below the line where you include ``grokcore.component``'s
        configuration) and the second line somewhere next to your other
        dependency includes.
        
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        Simple browser page
        -------------------
        
        A browser page is implemented by subclassing the
        ``grokcore.view.View`` baseclass.  At a minimum, a browser page must
        have
        
        1. an associated template (or implement the ``render`` method for direct
           control)
        
        2. a context that it's registered for as a view
        
        3. a name (which is, if not specified explicitly, the class's name in
           lower case characters).
        
        A browser page that does not use a template but just outputs some
        computed data also subclasses the ``grokcore.view.View`` baseclass.
        At a minimum, such a view must have
        
        1. a render() method
        
        2. a context that it's registered for as a view
        
        3. a name (which is, if not specified explicitly, the class's name in
           lower case characters).
        
        For example, the following class defines a view that's registered for
        all objects and simply prints "Hello World!"::
        
          import grokcore.view
          import zope.interface
        
          class Hello(grokcore.view.View):
              grokcore.view.context(zope.interface.Interface)
        
              def render(self):
                  self.response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain")
                  return "Hello World!"
        
        Here we've made use of the implicit name feature.  This class will be
        available as the ``hello`` view for all objects.  So for instance,
        you'll be able to invoke it with URLs like::
        
          http://localhost/some/obj/hello
        
        We could also have spelled this out explicitly::
        
          class Hello(grokcore.view.View):
              grokcore.view.context(zope.interface.Interface)
              grokcore.view.name('hello')
        
              ...
        
        Browser page with template
        --------------------------
        
        Of course, more than often a view should render HTML which you would
        construct using some sort of templating engine.  ``grokcore.view``
        comes with built-in support for Zope's PageTemplate engine.  By
        convention, PageTemplate templates end with the ``.pt`` extension.
        
        So let our ``Hello`` view render HTML instead of plain text, we remove
        the ``render()`` method from the class and instead we create a
        template, e.g. like so::
        
          <html>
          <body>
            <p>Hello <span tal:replace="request/principal/title" />!</p>
          </body>
          </html>
        
        This will greet a logged in user with his or her actual name.
        
        Such a template-using page is a subclass of ``grokcore.view.View``::
        
          import grokcore.view
          import zope.interface
        
          class Hello(grokcore.view.View):
              grokcore.view.context(zope.interface.Interface)
        
        
        To associate the template with the view, we have to put it in a
        certain place.  Let's say the ``Hello`` view class from above was in
        an ``app.py`` module.  Then we create an ``app_templates`` directory
        next to it and place the template file in there (the name of this
        directory can be customized with the ``templatedir`` directive, see
        below).  The file name can be anything as long as the extension is
        ``.pt``.  However, we can again make use of a convention here.  If we
        name the template like the class (except in lower case characters),
        then the template and the class are associated automatically.  If not,
        we would have to use the ``template`` directive on the view class to
        spell out the name of the template file explicitly.
        
        To cut a long story short, if we named it ``app_templates/hello.pt``,
        it would be found automatically.
        
        Static resources
        ----------------
        
        Browser pages often need additional static resources like CSS and JavaScript
        files. These can be conveniently placed into a directory called ``static`` in
        the package that contains the view code. When this directory exists it will
        automatically be registered as a resource directory. It then is available as
        the ``static`` variable in all views of this package and you can refer to files
        inside this directory like so::
        
          <img src="hello.png" tal:attributes="src static/hello.png" />
        
        DirectoryResource
        -----------------
        
        In addition to the very convenient "static resources", one can use more
        explicitly configured and flexible DirectoryResource components.
        DirectoryResource component allow for differentiating resources based on layers
        and names and provide a way to register resources in one package and make use
        of these resources in another package's views::
        
          class FooResource(grokcore.view.DirectoryResource):
              grokcore.view.path('foo')
        
        Or with an explicit name::
        
          class BarResource(grokcore.view.DirectoryResource):
              grokcore.view.name('bar')
              grokcore.view.path('bar')
        
        Registered for a layer::
        
          class BazResource(grokcore.view.DirectoryResource):
              grokcore.view.layer(ISomeLayer)
              grokcore.view.path('baz/qux')
        
        Layers and skins
        ----------------
        
        To define a browser layer, simply extend the ``IBrowserRequest``
        interface::
        
          class IGreenLayer(grokcore.view.IBrowserRequest):
              pass
        
        If you then wanted to define a skin, simply inherit from all the layer
        interfaces that should be in the skin and use the ``skin()`` directive
        to give the layer a name::
        
          class IGreenSkin(IGreenLayer, grokcore.view.IDefaultBrowserLayer):
              grokcore.view.skin('Green')
        
        To place a view on a layer, simply use the ``layer`` directive::
        
          class Hello(grokcore.view.View):
              grokcore.view.context(zope.interface.Interface)
              grokcore.view.layer(IGreenLayer)
        
              ...
        
        
        API overview
        ============
        
        Base classes
        ------------
        
        ``View``
            Base class for browser pages.  Use the ``context`` directive to
            specify the view's context.  Use the ``name`` directive to set the
            view's name; if not used, the view's name will be the class's name
            in lower case characters.  You may also use the ``template``
            directive to specify the name of the template file that should be
            associated with the view as well as the ``layer`` directive to
            specify which layer it should be on if not the default layer.
            Implement the ``render`` method to forgo looking up a template
            and show the result of calling the render method instead.
        
        View API
        --------
        
        ``grokcore.view.View`` is a regular Zope browser page, so it behaves
        exactly like a regular browser page from the outside.  It provides a
        bit more to the developer using it as a base class, though:
        
        ``context``
            The view's context object.  This can be discriminated by using the
            ``context`` directive on the view class.
        
        ``request``
            The request object, typically provides ``IBrowserRequest``.
        
        ``response``
            The response object, typically provides ``IHTTPResponse``.
        
        ``static``
            Directory resource representing the package's ``static`` directory or None
            if no such directory was found during grokking.
        
        ``redirect(url)``
            Redirect to the given URL.
        
        ``url(obj=None, name=None, data=None)``
            Constructs a URL:
        
            * If no arguments are given, the URL to the view itself is
              constructed.
        
            * If only the ``obj`` argument is given, the URL to that object is
              constructed.
        
            * If both ``obj`` and ``name`` arguments are supplied, construct
              the URL to the object and append ``name`` (presumably the name
              of a view).
        
            Optionally, ``data`` can be a dictionary whose contents is added to
            the URL as a query string.
        
        Method for developers to implement:
        
        ``update(**kw)``
            This method will be called before the view's associated template
            is rendered.  If you therefore want to pre-compuate values for the
            template, implement this method.  You can save the values on
            ``self`` (the view object) and later access them through the
            ``view`` variable from the template.  The method can take
            arbitrary keyword parameters which are filled from request values.
        
        ``render(**kw)`` 
            Return either an encoded 8-bit string or a unicode string.  The method can
            take arbitrary keyword parameters which are filled from request values.
            If not implemented, a template is looked up in the template dir instead.
        
        
        Directives
        ----------
        
        ``templatedir(dirname)``
             Module-level directive that tells the template machinery which
             directory to look in for templates that should associated with
             views in a particular module.  If not used, it defaults to
             ``<module_name>_templates``.
        
        ``template(filename_wo_ext)``
            Class-level directive that specifies the name a template file
            that's associated with a view class, *without* the file extension.
            If not used, it defaults to the class's name in lower case
            characters.
        
        ``layer(layer_interface)``
            Class-level directive that defines which layer the view is
            registered on.  If not used, it defaults to the
            ``IDefaultBrowserLayer``.
        
        ``skin(skin_name)``
            Directive used on a layer interface to register it as skin using a
            human-readable name (``skin_name``).
        
        ``path(relative_or_absolute_path)``
            Directove used in a DirectoryResource registration to point to a non-
            package directory(hierarchy) containing resources like images, css files,
            etc.
        
        Other
        -----
        
        ``url(request, obj, name=None, data=None)``
            Generate the URL to an object, with an optional view name
            attached.  The ``data`` argument can be a dictionary whose
            contents is converted into the a query string that's appended to
            the URL.
        
        ``PageTemplate(template_code)``
            Create an inline PageTemplate object.
        
        ``PageTemplateFile(filename)``
            Create a PageTemplate object from a file.
        
        ``IBrowserRequest``
            Browser request interface from ``zope.publisher``.
        
        ``IDefaultBrowserLayer``
            Default layer for browser components from ``zope.publisher``.
        
        
        In addition, the ``grokcore.view`` package exposes the
        `grokcore.component`_ and `grokcore.security`_ APIs.

        Changes
        =======
        
        2.11 (2016-05-09)
        -----------------
        
        - In the template directory grokker, ignore directories and files
          without extensions.
        
        
        2.10.2 (2016-02-02)
        -------------------
        
        - Update tests.
        
        
        2.10.1 (2014-07-29)
        -------------------
        
        - Fix broken MANIFEST.in
        
        
        2.10 (2014-07-29)
        -----------------
        
        - Add an helper ``render_provider`` to look up and render a given
          content provider.
        
        
        2.9 (2014-05-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Make possible to disable the template warning with the help of the
          ``GROK_DISABLE_TEMPLATE_WARNING`` environment variable.
        
        - The ``skin`` option of ``grokcore.view.util.url`` now accepts
          strings that will be used as skin name as possible alternative to a
          skin interface.
        
        - The ``skin`` directive can now be used on interfaces that inherits
          only from ``IRequest`` instead of ``IBrowserRequest``.
        
        2.8 (2012-12-11)
        ----------------
        
        - Add a ``skin=[skin component]`` argument to the ``grokcore.view.util.url()``
          function and ``grokcore.view.components.View.url`` method. This allows for
          computing URLs on a specific skin. Note that it is not verified whether
          the computed URL actually exist on the specified skin.
        
        2.7 (2012-05-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Use the component registration api in grokcore.component.
        
        - Improve error message when a templatedir() directive points to a non-
          existent directory. (fix launchpad issue 680528).
        
        - Improve error message when a template is required for a component
          but cannot be found (Fix Launchpad issue #225855, #242698).
        
        - Fix how the static resource are found. Instead of using as name the
          package name where the component is defined, using as name the
          package where the template for the component is defined, or the base
          component. This is done by setting an attribute ``__static_name__``
          on the component that specify which resource directory should be
          used. This fix missing resources when you extend the component and
          don't redefined the template.
        
        2.6.1 (2011-06-28)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix bug where zope.browserpage was not correctly declared as a dependency.
        
        2.6 (2011-06-28)
        ----------------
        
        - Add the ContentProvider component.
        
        2.5 (2011-04-04)
        ----------------
        
        - Fix a test that relied on older zope.testbrowser behaviour.
        
        2.4 (2011-03-01)
        ----------------
        
        - grok.View component can optionally use the ``grok.provides`` directive,
          specifying an interface that the component provides (instead of the
          zope.interface.Interface that views by default provide).
        
        - Add a new ZCML directive, ``ignoreTemplates`` that let you configure which
          template filename pattern should be ignored by the template registry. The
          pattern attribute of the directive accepts regular expresssion that will be
          matched against the (template) file extension.
        
        - Use the zope configuration action ordering feature to have templates
          registered for all packages and modules, before trying to associate the
          templates. Checking for unassociated templates is done very very late in the
          configuration action order.
        
        - Inherited grok.template() information is looked up against the module of
          the view class that uses the grok.template() directive. This allows for
          subclassing view components that use the grok.template() directive from other
          packages.
        
        2.3 (2011-01-04)
        ----------------
        
        - Removed the static directory grokker in order to make way for using
          fanstatic.
        
        2.2 (2010-12-16)
        ----------------
        
        - Factor out a base template grokker that associate templates for
          viewish components.
        
        - Merge support for a global template registry that removes
          unnecessary warnings about unassociated templates in "shared"
          template directories.
        
        2.1 (2010-11-03)
        ----------------
        
        - Use an update martian and grokcore.component.
        
        - The custom zope publication has now moved from the grok package to
          grokcore.view. The registration of the publication is optional, and is used
          by grok and the grokcore.json package.
        
        - The util function `make_checker` has been moved from the `grok`
          package to ``grokcore.view``.
        
        2.0 (2010-11-01)
        ----------------
        
        - The `view` directive has been moved from ``grokcore.viewlet`` to
          ``grokcore.view``.
        
        - The `IGrokSecurityView` has been moved from ``grok`` to
          ``grokcore.view``.
        
        - Fix the url() function to behave properly while passed an empty data dict.
        
        - Fix the url() method to accept the "status" and "trusted" arguments, passed
          on to the redirect method on the response object.
        
        - ``grokcore.view`` no longer depends on ``zope.app.testing`` and
          related packages. Instead we now use ``zope.app.wsgi.testlayer`` to
          run functional tests.
        
        - Made package comply to zope.org repository policy.
        
        - Fixed launchpad bug #395061 : removed the default_fallback_to_name
          function. It can be imported from ``grokcore.security`` if needed.
        
        - ``grokcore.view`` no longer depends on ``zope.app.zcmlfiles``. We
          removed all the extra dependencies and fixed one test that used
          ``zope.app.rotterdam`` and ``zope.app.basicskin``.
        
        - Back-ported the changes of the 1.13 branch related to the directory
          resource registration, using the latest ztk packages.
        
        - Factor out generally useful methods and properties for view-ish
          components into components.ViewSupport mixin.
        
        - Works with new Martian (0.13) and grokcore.component 2.1.
        
        - Test fix: support windows paths.
        
        - Warnings are now emitted as log messages with level
          `logging.WARNING` to a logger named ``grokcore.view`` with level
          `logging.ERROR`.
        
          That means that by default no warnings are emitted anymore (while
          errors will still appear).
        
          To get the warnings back, reduce the level of logger
          ``grokcore.view`` to `logging.WARNING` or lower. This can be done in
          Python or via a logging conf file, for instance in the .ini files of
          regular grokprojects. See the Python standard lib `logging` module
          for details.
        
        1.12.1 (2009-09-17)
        -------------------
        
        - A compatibility fix to support ``grokcore.viewlet``.
        
        1.12 (2009-09-17)
        -----------------
        
        - Use 1.0b1 versions.cfg in Grok's release info instead of a local
          copy; a local copy for all grokcore packages is just too hard to
          maintain.
        
        - Revert the splitting CodeView/View. The original reasons for the
          split have been obsoleted by the recent martain developments
          regarding inheritted module level directives. At the same time the
          split up components proved cumbersome to use and a too big a change
          between the 1.0a and 1.0b releases of Grok.
        
          View components will now again behave like it did up until the latest alpha
          release of Grok.
        
          ``CodeView`` is still available as a backwards compatibility alias
          for ``View``. Please update all references to ``CodeView`` to
          ``View``.
        
        - Fix the template registry and grokker for views to let View and
          other components using View as base class to be associated with a
          template directly by setting it as 'template' attribute on the view
          class. Example::
        
            class MyView(grokcore.view.View):
        
                template = grokcore.view.PageTemplate('<p>hello</p>')
        
          This isn't exactly *officially* supported but enough people depend
          on it and have documented it so that we don't want to just break it.
        
        1.11 (2009-09-15)
        -----------------
        
        - The response attribute needs to be available in CodeView as well.
        
        1.10 (2009-09-14)
        -----------------
        
        - Up the version requirement for grokcore.security to 1.2.
        
        - Bring versions.cfg in line with current grok versions.cfg.
        
        
        1.9 (2009-07-04)
        ----------------
        
        - Fix needed for grokcore.formlib: allow a base_method'ed render() on view.
          This allows grokcore.formlib to have a render() in addition to a template.
        
        - Reverted change to checkTemplates: for some formlib edge cases it detects
          the right templates again.
        
        
        1.8 (2009-07-04)
        ----------------
        
        - Add validator to templatedir directive to disallow path separator.
        
        - Splitted CodeView out of View.  View only uses templates, CodeView only uses
          a render() method.  So views that have a render method must subclass from
          CodeView instead of View (that should be the only change needed).
        
        - Add grok.View permissions to functional tests (requires grokcore.security 1.1)
        
        
        1.7 (2009-05-19)
        ----------------
        
        - Revert dependency from zope.container back to zope.app.container.
        
        
        1.6 (2009-04-28)
        ----------------
        
        - Simplify the DirectoryResource and DirectoryResourceFactory
          implementations by making better use of the hook points provided by
          zope.app.publisher.browser.directoryresource.
        
        1.5 (2009-04-10)
        ----------------
        
        - Don't register a 'static' resource directory if the 'static' directory does
          not exist.
        
        - Make it possible to instantiate an ungrokked view by being slightly more
          defensive in __init__. This makes it easier to write unit tests.
        
        1.4 (2009-04-08)
        ----------------
        
        * Page template reloading now also works for macros. Fixes
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/162261.
        
        * Use zope.container instead of zope.app.container.
        
        * Ignore '<tpl>.cache' files when looking up template files in a
          template dir. Fix bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/grok/+bug/332747
        
        1.3 (2009-01-28)
        ----------------
        
        * Adapt tests to work also from eggs not only source checkouts by
          avoiding `src` in directory comparisons.
        
        * Fix the factory for subdirectories of the DirectoryResource implementation
          by using hooks in zope.app.publisher.browser.directoryresource.
        
        * Update APIs interfaces to include the new ``path`` directive and
          new ``DirectoryResource`` component.
        
        1.2 (2008-10-16)
        ----------------
        
        * Expose the ``DirectoryResource`` class as a component for registering
          directories as resources. This is accompanied by the ``path`` directive that
          is used to point to the directory holding resources by way of an relative (to
          the module) or absolute path. ``DirectoryResource`` components can be
          differentiated by name and layer.
        
        1.1 (2008-09-22)
        ----------------
        
        * ``meta.py`` module containing the grokkers has been split in a
          package with separate modules for the view, template, skin and
          static resources grokkers. This allows applications to use only
          grokkers they need (and maybe redefine others).
        
        1.0 (2006-08-07)
        ----------------
        
        * Created ``grokcore.view`` in July 2008 by factoring security-related
          components, grokkers and directives out of Grok.
