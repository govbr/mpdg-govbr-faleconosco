Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This package provides a module-level source-code generator which
        operates on the AST from the built-in ``compiler.ast`` module.
        
        Note that this AST is not compatible with the new ``ast`` module in
        Python 2.6.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The generator works on AST parse trees.
        
          >>> from compiler import parse
          >>> tree = parse("""\
          ...     print 'Hello, world!'
          ... """)
        
        We can now generate Python-code equivalent to the original using the
        source-code generator.
          
          >>> from sourcecodegen import ModuleSourceCodeGenerator
          >>> generator = ModuleSourceCodeGenerator(tree)
          >>> print generator.getSourceCode()
          print 'Hello, world!'

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.6.14 (released 19/05/2011)
        
        - Fixed issue where an ``ast.Sliceobj`` outside the context of
          subscripts (this is an odd construct which is unfortunately
          understood by Python's legacy AST compiler, but not possible to
          reproduce from source code).
        
          The issue affects at least Zope's ``RestrictedPython`` package.

         - Fixed issue where the delete operator would not be treated as a

        0.6.5 (released 19/02/2009)
        
         - Fixed issue where a module docstring would cause an undesired

        0.6.4 (released 24/01/2009)
        
         - Added convenience method to generate code. [malthe]
        
        0.6.3 (released 18/12/2008)
        
         - Allow proper operation under Python 2.4 (try/finally
           fixes). [chrism]
        
        0.6.2 (released 14/12/2008)
        
         - Fixed issue where lambda blocks would be incorrectly indented;
           also, function bodies are now always properly cleared. [malthe]
        
        0.6.1 (released 13/12/2008)
        
         - Fixed issue where generators would not be prioritized in certain
           cases. [malthe]
        
        0.6 (released 13/12/2008)
        
         - Operator precedence is now taken into account such that we can
           avoid unnecessary use of parentheses. This is done not only for
           aesthetic reasons, but more importantly to avoid running into
           parser errors due to Python's nesting limitation. [malthe]
        
        0.5 (released 28/11/2008)
        
         - Added `yield` and unary operators. [malthe]
        
        0.4 (released 28/11/2008)
        
         - Make sure all binary operators get parentheses around them; we may
           be able to improve upon this in the future (for
           legibility-reasons). [malthe]
        
        0.3 (released 27/11/2008)
        
         - Added logical operators. [malthe]
        
         - Fixed tuple unpacking issues. [malthe]
        
         - Added for-loop. [malthe]
        
        0.2 (released 27/11/2008)
        
         - Fixed issue with tuples and parentheses. [malthe]

           no non-keyword arguments were present. [malthe]
        
         - Fixed issue where statements would not be cleared properly. [malthe]

         - Initial release.
